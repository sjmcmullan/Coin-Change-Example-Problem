# Coin-Change-Example-Problem
An interesting problem that my lecturer designed. 

**Problem Description**:

Samsung and Apple are two tech giants and the biggest rivals of each other. Recently, Samsung has lost a lawsuit against Apple and the court asked Samsung to pay one billion dollars to Apple. Samsung has no option other than paying the money, but theSamsung CEO has come up with an innovative idea to take revenge on Apple. He decided to pay the money in coins. There are unlimited coins in Samsungâ€™s vault and the values of coins are all primes e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, ... including 1 and a Gold coin. The Gold coin is equivalent to the amount to be paid.    Assume that you are the principal software engineer at Samsung. One morning, the CEO called you and described his plan to pay the money to Apple in coins.  He wants you to write a program that can calculate the total number of ways a given amount can be paid using a specified number of coins. For example, $5 can be paid in 6 different ways: 5 (Gold coin), 2+3, 1+1+3, 1+2+2, 1+1+1+2 and 1+1+1+1+1 using all possible coins. However, $8 can be paid in two ways 2+3+3 and 5+2+1 if three coins are used only.
